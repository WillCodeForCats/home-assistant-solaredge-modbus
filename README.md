I made a mess of this fork and wasn't sure how to fix it, so I started over. I've developed more features and ehnacements as I've learned more about Home Assistant and Python. Do not use this fork, use [WillCodeForCats/solaredge-modbus-multi](https://github.com/WillCodeForCats/solaredge-modbus-multi) or look for "SolarEdge Modbus Multi Device" in [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/). The new one is regulray updated, has more features, fixes, and just better overall.
